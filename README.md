# learncw

**learncw** is a simple web application designed to help you practice Morse Code (CW) skills locally. It allows you to test and improve your CW proficiency without needing a radio or physical key. The app uses the **space bar** as a straight key, so iambic fans might want to look elsewhere, but it's a great tool for anyone looking to practice!

The app also comes with a sleek theme and may receive additional features in the future.
